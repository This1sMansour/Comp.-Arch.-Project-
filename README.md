#	Assembly MIPS Multi-Cycle Simulation:
o	Led a team of three in developing an advanced MIPS compiler with a multicycle architecture.
o	Implemented the compiler in Java, inputting and cleaning the MIPS code. 
o	Translated the code to machine code and executed the MIPS cycle.
o	Printed register values at each clock cycle and at the program's end to showcase the execution and result.
