#	Assembly MIPS Multi-Cycle Simulation:
* Led a team of three in developing an advanced MIPS compiler with a multicycle architecture. \n
* Implemented the compiler in Java, inputting and cleaning the MIPS code. \n
* Translated the code to machine code and executed the MIPS cycle. \n
* Printed register values at each clock cycle and at the program's end to showcase the execution and result.
