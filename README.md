#	Assembly MIPS Multi-Cycle Simulation:
\t Led a team of three in developing an advanced MIPS compiler with a multicycle architecture. \n
\t	Implemented the compiler in Java, inputting and cleaning the MIPS code. \n
\t	Translated the code to machine code and executed the MIPS cycle. \n
\t	Printed register values at each clock cycle and at the program's end to showcase the execution and result.
